# Product Overview

This is a LangGraph learning repository that provides comprehensive examples and tutorials for building AI workflows and agents using LangGraph. The project serves as an educational resource demonstrating various patterns including:

- Basic chatbot implementation with memory management
- Workflow agents and routing patterns
- Parallelization and orchestrator-worker architectures
- Human-in-the-loop interactions
- Multi-agent systems

The repository contains both standalone Python modules and interactive Jupyter notebooks, progressing from basic concepts to advanced orchestration patterns. It supports multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, DashScope) and includes proper async handling for Jupyter environments.

Key learning outcomes include understanding LangGraph state management, memory/checkpointing, agent creation patterns, and workflow orchestration techniques.
